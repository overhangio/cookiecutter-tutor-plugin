Tutor plugin cookiecutter üç™
============================

This is a `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial2.html>`__ for getting started with `Tutor plugins <https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/plugins/index.html>`__. It will generate a base scaffold for an empty tutor plugin that does, well, nothing.

Requirements
------------

::

    pip install cookiecutter

Usage
-----

::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/overhangio/cookiecutter-tutor-plugin.git

Please keep the "contrib" part in your generated package name to differentiate from official plugins.

Once you have generated your plugin, you can start using it right away (even if it won't do anything)::

    pip install -e ./tutor-myplugin
    tutor plugins list # your plugin should appear here
    tutor plugins enable myplugin # hack at it!

Migrating from v0 plugins
-------------------------

The plugin API was upgraded from v0 to v1 in Tutor v13.2.0. This cookiecutter generates plugin scaffolds for v1. The v0 API will be supported for some time, but you are encouraged to upgrade your plugins. To upgrade a v0 plugin that was generated previously with this cookiecutter, perform the following steps:

- In setup.py: replace "tutor.plugin.v0" by "tutor.plugin.v1".

- In the templates folder: rename the "hooks" folder to "tasks".

- In plugin.py:

  - At the top of the file, add the following line::

        from tutor import hooks

  - Modify the ``config`` object:

    - If present, replace the "add" key by "unique".
    - If present, replace the "set" key by "overrides".

  - Delete the `templates` object.

  - Replace the ``hooks`` object:

    - If present, replace each "myservice" item in "init" by::

            hooks.Filters.COMMANDS_INIT.add_item((
                "myservice",
                ("yourplugin", "tasks", "myservice", "init"),
            ))

    - If present, replace each "myservice" item in "pre-init" by::

            hooks.Filters.COMMANDS_PRE_INIT.add_item((
                "myservice",
                ("yourplugin", "tasks", "myservice", "pre-init"),
            ))

    - If present, replace each ``"myimage": "myimage:latest"`` key/value in "build-image" by::

            hooks.Filters.IMAGES_BUILD.add_item((
                "myimage",
                ("plugins", "yourplugin", "build", "myimage"),
                "myimage:latest",
                (),
            ))

    - If present, replace each ``"myimage": "myimage:latest"`` key/value in "remote-image" by::

            hooks.Filters.IMAGES_PULL.add_item((
                "myimage",
                "myimage:latest",
            ))
            hooks.Filters.IMAGES_PUSH.add_item((
                "myimage",
                "myimage:latest",
            ))

  - Delete the ``patches`` function.

  - Add the following piece of code at the bottom of your file::

        ####### Boilerplate code
        # Add the "templates" folder as a template root
        hooks.Filters.ENV_TEMPLATE_ROOTS.add_item(
            pkg_resources.resource_filename("tutoryourplugin", "templates")
        )
        # Render the "build" and "apps" folders
        hooks.Filters.ENV_TEMPLATE_TARGETS.add_items(
            [
                ("yourplugin/build", "plugins"),
                ("yourplugin/apps", "plugins"),
            ],
        )
        # Load patches from files
        for path in glob(
            os.path.join(
                pkg_resources.resource_filename("tutoryourplugin", "patches"),
                "*",
            )
        ):
            with open(path, encoding="utf-8") as patch_file:
                hooks.Filters.ENV_PATCHES.add_item((os.path.basename(path), patch_file.read()))
        # Add configuration entries
        hooks.Filters.CONFIG_DEFAULTS.add_items(
            [
                (f"YOUR_PLUGIN_{key}", value)
                for key, value in config.get("defaults", {}).items()
            ]
        )
        hooks.Filters.CONFIG_UNIQUE.add_items(
            [
                (f"YOUR_PLUGIN_{key}", value)
                for key, value in config.get("unique", {}).items()
            ]
        )
        hooks.Filters.CONFIG_OVERRIDES.add_items(list(config.get("overrides", {}).items()))

  - In case the plugin has custom commands to be available from CLI, you will need to implement the CLI_COMMANDS filter according
    to `Tutor's reference documentation <https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/reference/api/hooks/consts.html#tutor.hooks.Filters.CLI_COMMANDS>`__.
    You can implement this filter by adding the following code line to plugin.py::
          tutor_hooks.Filters.CLI_COMMANDS.add_item(command)

  - Also, you will either need to rename the command function or use click's ``name=<plugin>`` argument.
    For example, to ensure your plugin command(s) are available under ``tutor xqueue ...``, you could write::
          @click.group(help="Interact with the Xqueue server", name="xqueue")
          def command():
              ...

  - Verify that the file contains no instance of "yourplugin" or "YOUR_PLUGIN". If it does, replace by your plugin name.

- Re-install your plugin.
- Verify that the plugin is listed when you run ``tutor plugins list``.
